1) How do you compile and run?
   Please copy and paste:
   mkdir build; cd build; cmake -j ..; make -j

2) Collaboration?
   None.

3) References?
   No references except Piazza, class notes, LOTS of debugging.

4) Known problems?
   I selected the best constants I could, but the pendulum particles
   stop bouncing up and down after maybe 2 oscillations. It does look
   like the sample solution though. Further, the particle moving in
   circular motion doesn't move as fast as the sample solution's.
   I can't really tell much about my cloth, since I didn't draw a
   smooth surface model, but it does behave and wiggle like a real
   piece of microfiber cloth that I have would. The wireframe looks
   good.

5) Extra credit?
   None. Too hard already.

6) Comments?
   Not that I can think of! So pleasing to see the end results.
